## Project Version Control Readme

## Welcome

Hello team! This readme explains why we use version control and how it helps us.

## What's Version Control?

 It remembers every change we make, helps us work together without messing things up, and lets us fix mistakes easily.

## Why it's Awesome

1. **Remember Changes:** It writes down every change, so we know who did what.

2. **Work Together:** We can all work on the project at the same time without causing chaos.

3. **Undo Mistakes:** Oops, something broke? No worries, we can go back to when it worked.

4. **See Differences:** Want to know what changed between now and yesterday? It can show us.

5. **Try New Ideas:** We can test crazy ideas in a safe space (branches) and only keep them if they work.

## Our Tool: Git

We use a tool called [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It's like the superhero librarian for our project.

## Let's Get Started

### 1. Install Git

If you don't have Git, [install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### 2. Grab the Project

Use this command to get our project:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Create a new branch for your work.
- Make your changes.
- Save them with these commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 4. Share Your Work

Keep in sync with everyone:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Ready to share your changes?

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 5. Bring Changes Together

When everyone's happy, merge your work back into the main project:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge your-branch-name.



**Git:**

- **What is it?** It keeps track of changes you make to your project so you can go back in time if something breaks.
  
- **How does it work?** It lives on your computer and watches over your project. You tell it when to remember changes (commit) or when to try out new stuff without messing up the main project (branch).

- **Who uses it?** It's for your personal use on your computer. You can use it even if you're not connected to the internet.

**GitHub:**

- **What is it?** GitHub stores your code and makes it easy for your team to work together.

- **How does it work?** It takes your Git-tracked project and puts it on the internet. This way, your team can access and work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes.

- **Who uses it?** It's for teams. When everyone's working on the same project, GitHub helps them stay organized and work smoothly.


Certainly, here are three alternatives to GitHub:

1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull

- **`git fetch`:** This command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository but does not automatically merge the changes into your current branch. It brings the changes into your local repository, allowing you to inspect and decide whether you want to merge them.

  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  ```

- **`git pull`:** This command not only retrieves changes from the remote repository but also automatically merges them into your current branch. It is essentially a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.

  ```bash
  git pull origin master
  ```

  **Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it**

**Git Rebase in Simple Terms:**

Git rebase is like editing your project's history to make it look clean and linear. It rearranges the order of your commits.

**Command for Git Rebase:**

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

**Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it**
**Git Cherry-Pick in Simple Terms:**

Cherry-picking in Git is like picking specific changes (or commits) from one branch and applying them onto another branch. It's like selecting only the changes you want and bringing them into your current work.

**Command for Git Cherry-Pick:**

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
